# Supplemental Materials to arXiv:2402:14917

W. Barker and S. Zell 

## About

These materials are designed to supplement our paper. They provide complete spectral analyses using the PSALTer package, and exhaustive searches for symmetric theories, which supplement the results presented in the appendices of arXiv:2402:14917.

## How to use 

- In the first instance, you should read the `SupplementalMaterials.pdf` file. 
- If you find some problem with the formatting of the pdf (the Mathematica pdf export is not flawless), you can explore the `Invariants.nb` or `ParticleSpectra.nb` notebook files. 
- If you wish to re-run either notebook, we will be happy to make the Wolfram Language sources available upon request. Note that you will need to have [installed xAct](http://www.xact.es/download.html) and also to have [installed PSALTer](https://github.com/wevbarker/PSALTer), and also to have [installed xPlain](https://github.com/wevbarker/xPlain).
